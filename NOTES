Verekia's Initializr versus HTML5 Boilerplate Initializr

$ diff -ru verekia-initializr/ boilerplate-initializr/ | less

The above shows that the download from initializr.com and
html5boilerplate.com are mostly identical except for the following:

verekia's has content in index.html and styles for that page added to
css/style.css

I like the newer libraries in html5boilerplate and that it pulls jQuery
from xcdn.  Plus it has more framework-y stuff, so I'm going with it to
redesign the blog.

However the verekia stuff has some real (basic) examples which should
not get thrown away so I'm keeping it around.

Golden Grid System versus HTML5Boilerplate

Both have CSS which do resets.  H5BP doesn't _really_ do any meaningful
media queries; on the other hand the media queries are the heart and
soul of GGS.

AI: transplant the media queries from GGS into H5BP's style.css and see
what happens!  Might have to load them on top of each other... but I
think the IE 6-8 stuff will clash since there are different ways of
fixing those problems...

Modernizr - http://www.modernizr.com/download/

Do I still want respond.js?  Can it be replaced entirely with ggs?

I need to think about the integration of ggs into the rest of the h5bp
stack; if it belongs in modernizr how about providing it as a community
add-on?
