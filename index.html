<p>
	deferred.io - should use mturquette.github.com as backing store hosting
	</br></br>
	diaspora - should run Tip of Tree, probably bad up-time, uses deferred.io domain
	</br></br>
	tumblr - instrumentation should be linked at mturquette.github.com/blog or deferred.io/blog
	</br></br>
	golden grid system - create static front page using GGS.  Maybe update tumblr's 'spanr' theme to use GGS also?
	</br></br>
	social networking tie-ins - should I pull down data from LinkedIn, Ohloh, twitter, facebook and googleplus?  Or I could just link to all of it through my about.me page...
