				</p>
				<p>
					blog - finalize css/look-n-feel, test on mobile devices & put up some damn content
				</p>
				<p>
					livefyre - switch from disquse to livefyre for comments

					<s>golden grid system - create static front page using GGS.  Maybe update tumblr's 'spanr' theme to use GGS also?</s>
				</p>
				<p>
