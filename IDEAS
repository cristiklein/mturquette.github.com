title at the top of index.html is:

deferred.io /

in big bold letters.  when a user clicks a link the "eferred.io" fades away in
an animation and the "/" slides to the left to make "d /".  Then the page
loads that the user clicks on (for example 2011-11-26-css-animations.textile)
and the rest of the title fades in, making "d / css animations".  Fancy!
