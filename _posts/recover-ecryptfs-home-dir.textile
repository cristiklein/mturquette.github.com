Capture the commands used to mount the secondary drive.  In particular note that this is NOT for recovery from a Live CD, but from a secondary drive which is not the root file system.

mount the drive (capture this in GUI form with a screenshot as well as a command-line form)
cd /media/mturquette/296039d0-0064-4ca2-ad67-2966a62c13c8
this is the drive
cd home
ls -a


---

$ cd /media/mturquette/296039d0-0064-4ca2-ad67-2966a62c13c8/home/
$ ls -a
.  ..  .ecryptfs  mturquette
$ cd .ecryptfs/mturquette/
$ sudo ecryptfs-recover-private .Private/

Note that if one goes to home/mturquette/.Private and tries to run ecryptfs-recover-private on that directory then it will just remount the private home directory of the PRIMARY drive, which is undesirable.

Continue with more verbose commands and screenshots.

Finish with umounting the drive, including clearing any keys from the keystore.  Be sure to link to Dustin Kirkland at some point along the way.
