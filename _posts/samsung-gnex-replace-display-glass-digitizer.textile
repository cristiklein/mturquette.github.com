Capture part numbers of both Toro and Toroplus.

Link to Amazon deals for display/glass/digitizer.

Explain that digitizer just means touch screen.

Create an html anchor for "Tear down from a spare gnex"
For folks with a spare gnex first show how to do the teardown to remove the display.  Link to ifixit.com's guide:
http://www.ifixit.com/Device/Samsung_Galaxy_Nexus

For folks with ready-to-rock spare parts (purchased from amazon or whatever) then they can skip the above section by clicking on a link to the next anchor.

Create an anchor to the section for removing the old display/glass/digitizer.  In fact this nullifies all of the silly anchor business (but logically separating my sections is still a good idea).  This shows how to remove the broken display from the phone, and can double as instructions for removing the good display from a spare phone.

Create an anchor for the final section on how to install the good display into the phone, boot and verify correctness.

Screenshots all around, look into re-using ifixit's material (license and redistribution rights) and be sure to give credit where credit is due.
