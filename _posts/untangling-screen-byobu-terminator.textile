* screen multiplexes terminals, but does NOT support vertically split windows by default
** there is a patch for that, and it should be officially supported in screen 4.1
* byobu is basically one big screen instance
** doesn't work well if you have been using screen for a long time because,
*** 1) heavy screen customizations might cause failures
*** 2) if you like to have multiple screen sessions then byobu is not for you: it targets having one big screen session that contains all of your terminal windows.  this is bad if you like to split up screen sessions by topic/activity.
*** 3) as a corrolary to #2, you can't have multiple instances of byobu... every time you run the command you just get another window which multiplexes your existing byobu instance
* terminator allows for vertically split terminals
** doesn't solve the problem of having multiple vertically split terminals that belong to the _same_screen_session_ displayed
** still does a good job of managing discrete screen sessions (e.g: code on the left in session "kernel" and serial console on the right in session "tty"
