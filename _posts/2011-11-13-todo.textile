title: Todo
---

* -deferred.io - should use mturquette.github.com as backing store hosting-
* diaspora - should run Tip of Tree, probably bad up-time, uses deferred.io domain
* -tumblr - instrumentation should be linked at mturquette.github.com/blog or deferred.io/blog-
* blog - finalize css/look-n-feel, test on mobile devices & put up some damn content
* livefyre - switch from disquse to livefyre for comments
* -golden grid system - create static front page using GGS.  Maybe update tumblr's 'spanr' theme to use GGS also?-
** should I use "Frameless":http://framelessgrid.com/ instead?
* social networking tie-ins - should I pull down data from LinkedIn, Ohloh, twitter, facebook and googleplus?
** Or I could just link to all of it through my about.me page...
