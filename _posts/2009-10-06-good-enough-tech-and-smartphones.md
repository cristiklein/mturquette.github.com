I was reading Wired’s article on "good enough tech", specifically regarding the popular Flip video recorder, and I couldn’t help but think, “we’re going to gobble them up”.
The “we’re” in that sentence sort of kind of being Texas Instruments, Inc. at first (my employer), but eventually the idea expanded to all applications processors and phone manufacturers.  The “them” in the above sentence being every device manufacturer ever that made a successful product on the cheap to fit a niche.
We’ve already got chips available for purchase right now that can record and playback 720p video.  In a phone.  That you already carry with you.
This is the often-talked about Convergence Device(tm).  So my question is, what other devices will be gobbled up by the ever-expanding capabilities of smart phones?  Will I not need a separate garage door opener someday soon?
I’m a cyclist and a runner and I think its stupid that I have a separate watch from Polar for measuring my heart rate and a Cat-Eye cycloputer for determining speed/cadence on the bike.  I don’t want a new watch and a new cycloputer!  These products should really just be a heart rate chest-strap and a set of Hall-effect sensors on my chain stay; I should be using my phone and possibly the ANT+ protocol to receive the data from the sensors.  This is the sort of thing that Quarq is betting on.  Nike+ is also a fine example of cutting out the middle man altogether.
In the future it will probably just be peripherals and your cell phone.  Though in the future it won’t be called a cell phone it will be a magic device built in to your sunglasses with a jiggabit/s connection to the moon.  Or something.  Either way I think that good enough tech is all fine and dandy but no amount of love for lots of cheap, crappy devices will keep the market forces at bay.  Commoditization is real and it is coming.  You have been warned.
